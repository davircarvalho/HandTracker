# HandTracker
Computer vision to interact with virtual reality scenarios using hand gestures

*Built on top of [mediapipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/).*

**Under development**: Still not a realiable model


## known issues
- Elevation only outputs zeros (it's a work in progress);


Better documentation may or may not come in the future
