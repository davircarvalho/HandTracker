# HandTracker
Computer vision to interact with virtual reality scenarios using hand gestures

*Built on top of [mediapipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/).*

**Under development**: Still not a realiable model


## known issues
- Landmarks jittering, specially when the hands are positined close to the ears; this may produce loud noises, be careful 
- Elevation only outputs zeros (it's a work in progress);


Better documentation may or may not come in the future
